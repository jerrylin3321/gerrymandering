# Fair and Unbiased Districting

This repo is the home of the data and Python scripts/Jupyter notebooks that accompany the extended abstract of Algorithms for Fair and Unbiased Redistricting. This research was conducted as part of the
2020 Duke University CS+ Program and under the supervision of Prof. Brandon Fain and Vaishali Jain.

# Organization

Generally speaking, the repo has been organized into separate code and data segments, though there may be some overlap in the data_processing sections. Pathing to the data will likely need to be modified to suit your machine, though all references to data are internal to this repo.

# Code

## data_processing

### `data_processing_pipeline.py`

Contains the CLI version of the original data processing pipeline. This was primarily designed for use with precinct level data, though conceivably, it could be modified to use VTDs with relatively trivial modifications.
